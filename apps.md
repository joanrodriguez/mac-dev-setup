# MacOS Desktop Applications

These are the first applications that I usually install on my new mac.

## Divvy

Set up shortcuts to resize and move your windows instantly.

## Franz

Consolidated messaging app: puts the web apps of Slack, Whatsapp, Skype, Facebook, Gmail etc each in one tab inside the same window. Very convenient.

## Little Snitch

The best mac firewall.

## 1Password

Don't use the same password for everything. Don't write them down. Use at least 50 characters and one chinese character... How are you supposed to cope? 1Password. 

## Parallels

The best way to run Windows on your mac.

## Dropbox

You know it.

## Sketch

If design things.
